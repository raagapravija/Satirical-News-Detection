# Satirical-News-Detection
 This project systematically compares four distinct NLP paradigms for distinguishing satirical news (The Onion) from real news (HuffPost, CNN, Reuters). Results reveal a fundamental gap: zero-shot LLMs detect linguistic sarcasm (74% accuracy), while fine-tuned models learn source-specific patterns (88% accuracy).
